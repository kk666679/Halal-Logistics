# TODO: System Architecture Upgrade - Blockchain, IPFS, and OCI Integration

## **System Architecture Upgrade: Frontend and Backend Integration**

Enhance both the frontend and backend architecture by seamlessly integrating the following technologies, each utilized to their full potential:

---

#### **1. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Blockchain**

* Migrate backend services and databases to OCI to ensure greater scalability, reliability, and security.
* Deploy microservices using OCI Functions or Kubernetes for efficient, cloud-native operations.
* Use OCI Object Storage for secure and scalable management of large datasets and media files.
* Implement OCI Identity and Access Management (IAM) for enterprise-grade access control and user authentication.

---

#### **2. Blockchain Smart Contracts – Hyperledger Fabric**

* Develop and deploy smart contracts on **Hyperledger Fabric** to manage critical backend logic that requires decentralized, permissioned execution (e.g., asset transfers, access control, data validation).
* Integrate frontend applications with Hyperledger smart contracts to enable secure, direct interactions.
* Incorporate blockchain event listeners to support real-time UI updates based on ledger state changes.

---

#### **3. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)**

* Utilize IPFS to store documents, media, and metadata in a decentralized manner, ensuring content persistence and availability.
* Link IPFS content hashes within smart contracts to guarantee data integrity and enable immutable references.
* Integrate IPFS into the frontend to allow seamless retrieval and rendering of distributed content.

### **Frontend & Backend Synchronization**

Deliver a clean, modern, and responsive frontend that reflects the enhanced backend architecture—displaying blockchain transaction states, IPFS content, and OCI-powered functionality. Prioritize modular, scalable code to support ongoing feature development and future integrations.
