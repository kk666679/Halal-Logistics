# TODO: Align Routes & Connect with UI/UX

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Edit WireframeSidebar.tsx to replace placeholders with functional next/link components for /dashboard, /products, /tracking, /certification, /ai-agent, /profile, and handle logout.
- [x] Create app/dashboard/page.tsx with dashboard content using existing components.
- [x] Create app/products/page.tsx with products/inventory content using inventory components.
- [x] Create app/profile/page.tsx with user profile content using auth components.
- [x] Check and update auth-context.tsx to redirect to /dashboard after login.
- [x] Run the app to test navigation and UX flows (login → dashboard → products, etc.). - App running on localhost:3000, navigation working, pages serving 200.
- [ ] Integrate API services in pages for dynamic data fetching.
