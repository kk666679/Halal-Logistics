# GLFS Microservices Implementation TODO

## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup âœ…
- [x] Create microservices/ directory structure
- [x] Set up freight-booking service with HTTP API and Kafka integration
- [x] Configure Prisma schema for freight-booking
- [x] Set up API Gateway project
  - [x] Create microservices/api-gateway/ with NestJS structure (package.json, main.ts, app.module.ts, gateway config)
  - [x] Configure proxy routes for /products to inventory-service, /quotes to freight-booking
- [x] Update docker-compose.yml for all services
  - [x] Create root docker-compose.yml with api-gateway, inventory-service, freight-booking, postgres, kafka, zookeeper
- [x] Configure Kafka topics for inter-service communication
  - [x] Add Kafka init for topics: product-events, inventory-updates, quote-events, booking-events

## Detailed Steps for Phase 1 & 2 (Inventory Service)
- [x] 1. Update inventory-service/prisma/schema.prisma (enhance Product model)
- [x] 2. Create inventory-service/src/products/dto/*.dto.ts (CreateProductDto, UpdateProductDto)
- [x] 3. Create inventory-service/src/products/products.service.ts (full CRUD from backend)
- [x] 4. Create inventory-service/src/products/products.controller.ts (REST endpoints)
- [x] 5. Update inventory-service/src/products/products.module.ts (import PrismaModule, DTOs)
- [x] 6. Update inventory-service/src/app.module.ts (import ProductsModule)
- [x] 7. Ensure inventory-service/package.json deps (@nestjs/prisma, etc.)
- [x] 8. Comment out ProductsModule in backend/src/app.module.ts
- [x] 9. Prisma migrate & generate in inventory-service
- [x] 10. Test inventory-service endpoints
- [ ] 11. Set up API Gateway (as above)
- [ ] 12. Create & test docker-compose.yml
- [ ] 13. Configure Kafka topics

## Phase 2: Core Services Extraction
- [x] Freight Booking & Quotation Service (from booking/products modules)
- [x] Inventory & Products Management Service (from products module)
- [x] Freight Order Management Service (from products/shipment modules)
- [x] Cargo Tracking Service (from tracking module)
- [ ] Billing Service (from billing module)
- [ ] Analytics Service (from analytics module)

## Phase 3: New Services Implementation
- [ ] Carrier Scheduling Service (new)
- [ ] Rate Management Service (from products/billing)
- [ ] Customs Clearance Service (from customs/certification)
- [ ] Multimodal Routing Service (from warehouse/delivery)

## Phase 4: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Update frontend services for microservices endpoints
- [ ] Implement inter-service messaging (Kafka)
- [ ] Test critical-path endpoints with curl
- [ ] Update deployment documentation

## Phase 5: Optimization
- [ ] Split database schemas per service
- [ ] Add monitoring and health checks
- [ ] Implement service discovery
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization
